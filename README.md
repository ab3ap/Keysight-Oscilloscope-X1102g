This is an example of using scpi commands to control your Keysight
hobby scope, an X1102G.  It is simple enough to be a starting point 
for other efforts, but interesting enough to do something worthwhile.
A Keysight employee urged me to share this.

The plots are based on an RC circuit breadboarded to get a frequency
response worth plotting.
